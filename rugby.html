          The team perform a haka before every match; this is a Māori challenge
          or posture dance. Traditionally the All Blacks use Te Rauparaha's haka
          Ka Mate, although players have also performed Kapa o Pango since 2005.

          The New Zealand national rugby union team, commonly known as the All
          Blacks,[1][2] represents New Zealand in men's international rugby
          union, which is considered the country's national sport.[3] Famed for
          their international success, the All Blacks have often been regarded
          as one of the most successful sports teams in history.[4][5] The team
          won the Rugby World Cup in 1987, 2011, and 2015, second only to South
          Africa's Springboks, who have won the Rugby World Cup four times.[a]
          They were the first country to retain the Rugby World Cup. Since their
          international debut in 1903, the All Blacks have played test matches
          against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the
          team. New Zealand has a 77 per cent winning record in test match
          rugby, and has secured more wins than losses against every test
          opponent.

          The team has also played against three multinational all-star teams,
          losing only 8 of 45 matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby
          Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer
          than all other teams combined.[6] They jointly hold the record for the
          most consecutive test match wins for a tier-one ranked nation, along
          with England. The All Blacks compete with Argentina, Australia and
          South Africa in the Rugby Championship, and have won the trophy twenty
          times in the competition's 28-year history. The team has completed a
          Grand Slam tour against the four Home Nations four times (1978, 2005,
          2008 and 2010). World Rugby has named New Zealand the World Rugby Team
          of the Year ten times since the award was initiated in 2001,[7] and an
          All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award ten times
          over the same period. Nineteen former All Blacks have been inducted
          into the World Rugby Hall Of Fame.
