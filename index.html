              New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in
              the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main
              landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island
              (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the
              sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia
              across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia,
              Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp
              mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic
              uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is
              Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.

              The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to
              be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians
              began to settle in the islands and then subsequently developed a
              distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman
              became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1769
              the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European
              to set foot on and map New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of
              the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi
              which paved the way for Britain's declaration of sovereignty later
              that year and the establishment of the Crown Colony of New Zealand
              in 1841. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial
              government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and
              confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. New Zealand became a
              dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947,
              retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority of New
              Zealand's population of 5.25 million is of European descent; the
              indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and
              Pasifika. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived
              from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of
              culture arising from increased immigration to the country. The
              official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign
              Language, with the local dialect of English being dominant.
